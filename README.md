# Lift Off!

![Screenshot](/screenshot.png?raw=true)

This was my (unfinished at the time) entry for
[Ludum Dare 45](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/45/lift-off). In an effort
to finish more projects I polished it up some more after the compo ended :)

I chose to start from scratch with SDL, which meant reimplementing tilemap
rendering and collision detection. That kind of stuff is fun for me, but
definitely didn’t make for rapid development :) Maybe will try Unity next time
if I want to focus more on unique game mechanics.

Definite props to the Emscripten folks. It was relatively painless to get this
up and compiling there. I’m not very familiar with JavaScript, so this made it a
lot easier to get running online.
